We made a "Avatar the last air bender" themed Risk (The game).
The SVG files is made for the K40 Wissperrer for laser cutting our Risk map in 4 pieces of 500x400x3 mm wood.


For building the project you will need:
  1. Arduino Uno R3.
  2. 4 pieces of 20 Leds round NeoPixel.
  3. 4 buttons.
  4. 4 pieces of 500x400x3 mm wood.
  5. 4 pieces of 12x12x3 mm acrylic.
  6. 2 pieces of 1000x50x10 wood.
  7. 3 pieces of 650x50x10 wood.
  8. 2 pieces of 500x50x10 wood (for support).
  9. 2 pieces of 100x100x25 (4 trianges for support).
  10. 10 pieces of 3d printed "Appa" for each player.
  11. 20 pieces of 3d printed "" for each player.
  12. 40 pieces of 3d printed "Fire Nation Soldiers" for each player.
      
cool ideas to add:
  1. motors to move the player circles.
  2. mp3 and a microphone to play sound if no one is talking for some amount of time.
  3. create more territories and add more players.
